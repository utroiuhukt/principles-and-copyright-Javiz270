# Answers to Questions

## 1. What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation?

The **Four Freedoms**, as defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), are:

- **Freedom 0**: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- **Freedom 1**: The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your needs. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- **Freedom 2**: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
- **Freedom 3**: The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

These freedoms ensure that users have full control over the software they use and promote collaboration and sharing within the software community.

## 2. How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?

The **GNU Manifesto**, written by Richard Stallman in 1985, justifies the ethical importance of free software by emphasizing the following points:

- **Freedom and Collaboration**: Software should be free to use, modify, and share, as restricting these freedoms harms society and limits innovation.
- **The Golden Rule**: Sharing software is a moral obligation, akin to treating others as you would like to be treated.
- **Preventing Proprietary Control**: Proprietary software creates a power imbalance, where developers control users. Free software ensures that users retain control over their computing.
- **Community Benefit**: Free software fosters a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute and benefit, rather than being restricted by proprietary barriers.

The manifesto argues that software freedom is essential for ethical computing and a more equitable society.

## 3. What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?

While **open source** and **free software** often refer to similar types of software, they emphasize different values:

### Free Software
- Focuses on **ethical and philosophical principles**.
- Emphasizes the user's freedom to run, study, modify, and distribute software.
- The term "free" refers to freedom (as in "free speech"), not price.
- Promoted by the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**.

### Open Source
- Focuses on **practical benefits**.
- Highlights advantages like improved software quality, security, and innovation through collaborative development.
- Promoted by the **Open Source Initiative (OSI)**.

### Key Difference
- **Free software** prioritizes **user freedom**.
- **Open source** prioritizes **development efficiency and transparency**.

In practice, most free software is also open source, and vice versa. However, the difference lies in the under the motivations behind them.
